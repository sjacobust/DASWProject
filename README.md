# DASWProject - Wiki for Video Games

Proyecto para Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web

## Description

This is a small development project focused solely on doing a mini Wiki Page. The Wiki is about videogames and
videogame only. It has the ability to create users that, in turn, can write or edit different articles about the
game they want. However, if someone isn't interested in writing or editing, they can browse the articles.

There are different ways to check up on the games you want. For example, you can search them in the search bar or
look them up by genre or just browse the list of games in the wiki. In the end, this is a wiki by the community and
for the community.
